# AI-chatbot-health-diagnosis

This is my final year project, which was made to get Bachelor degree. 

AI chatbot for health diagnosis is a web app using Infermedica API. 


This chat is using NLP and Database from Infermedica.

Speech-to-text recognition component was also developed but not implemented.

Chatbot asks user for symptoms and asks questions regarding symptoms or gives back the diagnosis.

The whole conversation is noted in terminal aswell.
